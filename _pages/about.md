Hi! I am a senior undergraduate at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. I major in computer science and technology at School of Electronic and Information Engineering and will be graduating in July, 2025. I am now working as a Visiting Undergraduate Student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics.

I am actively searching for internships, master programs and PhD opportunities which can allow me to take my research into next level.

Research Overview
======
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, especially in Language Modeling and universal attacks in NLP. To be more specific, I am really interested in understanding the **embeddings** in language model. What is the inner connection between output distribution and input embeddings? Why certain input embeddings are outputting certain distributions? Can we build a successful enough inverse language modeling approach? These are all questions I am trying to answer these days.

Updates
======
**September 2024**: I am working as a research assistant at [Compling Lab](https://compling-wat.com/) with Prof [Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/) at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)! My first research project here focuses on exploring potential limitations in language modeling by analyzing output logits and input embeddings. It's an incredibly exciting and enjoyable project!

**Jan 2024**: I am studying as an exchange student at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), and I will be taking 3 courses here including [CS2108: Introduction to Media Computing](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2108/introduction-to-media-computing), [CS3245: Information Retrieval](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS3245/information-retrieval) and [IS3107: Data Engineering](https://nusmods.com/courses/IS3107/data-engineering).

Publications
======
Expecting to come in October.
