Hi! I am a senior undergraduate at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China. I major in computer science and technology at School of Electronic and Information Engineering and will be graduating in July, 2025. I will be working as a Visiting Scholar at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, Faculty of Mathematics, term from 15 September 2024 to 31 December 2024, on the recommendation of Professor [Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/). Currently, I am focusing on my work in analyzing the probability distributions defined by language models.

I am actively searching for internships, master programs and PhD opportunities which can allow me to take my research into next level.

Research Overview
======
My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, especially in works of aligning LLMs with human values, building Helpful, Harmless and Honest Large Language models.

My **research vision** is to build a system that can balance both helpfulness and harmlessness. And to build a system like this, I want to dive into the field of building a trustworthy and explainable AI system.

Updates
======
**May 2024**: I will be joining research work with Prof [Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/) at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). We are working on a project to analyze the difficulty of triggering different desirable distributions using prefix tuning. And from my perspective, the result of work is **promising** so far, and later it can be applied to other LLM field, including LLM security problems.

**Jan 2024**: I am studying as an exchange student at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), and I will be taking 3 courses here including [CS2108: Introduction to Media Computing](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2108/introduction-to-media-computing), [CS3245: Information Retrieval](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS3245/information-retrieval) and [IS3107: Data Engineering](https://nusmods.com/courses/IS3107/data-engineering).

Publications
======
Expecting to come in October.
